Although the library is free to use, it can take some time and
effort to understand the library and to acquire sufficient
skill to make a working and well-designed event-sourced system.
Training workshops and development services are available to
support professional users of the library in accomplishing their
goals. Community support is also available.

Training workshops

Training workshops are available to help developers more
quickly learn how to use the library. Workshop participants

the library effectively.
